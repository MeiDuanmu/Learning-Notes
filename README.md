* Time series Data (evenly spaced, ordered, dependent on the past)<br>
* Time series analysis (analyze, explain and predict the pattern in time series data)<br>
* Components of time series data (trend, cycle, seasonality, irregularity)<br>
* Decomposition of a time series (additive vs multiplicative) <br>
* Stationarity (statistical properies remain constant over time) ADF test <br>
* Convert nonstationary to stationary method (differcing, deseasonlization) <br>
